    <h2 class="section-title">1. The Silent Struggle</h2>
    <p>In the heart of our prosperous city, unseen struggles unfold behind closed doors. Children with dreams as bright as any, but with resources too scarce to pursue them. Families working tirelessly, yet unable to break free from the cycle of hardship. These are not just numbers—they are our neighbours, our future.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2 class="section-title">2. The Growing Divide</h2>
    <p>While programmes like UPLIFT and KidSTART offer critical support, too many fall through the cracks. The widening educational gap threatens to leave behind those who most need a helping hand. A child’s future should not be dictated by their postal code or household income.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2 class="section-title">3. When Barriers Become Walls</h2>
    <p>Imagine children trying to learn on cracked phone screens, sharing one aging laptop among siblings, or going without internet access. This is the daily reality for many. These barriers don’t just slow learning—they shatter confidence and steal hope.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2 class="section-title">4. A Vision for Hope: The EdTech Solution</h2>
    <p>We envision a nation where no child is left behind. Our EdTech platform will unlock doors once closed to disadvantaged students. Features include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Learning accessible on any device, anywhere</li>
        <li>Free core and enrichment programmes to inspire and empower</li>
        <li>24/7 mentoring and homework help to guide the lost and uplift the struggling</li>
        <li>Data tools to identify and support those at risk early</li>
        <li>Community learning hubs providing safe, connected spaces to thrive</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2 class="section-title">5. The Road Ahead</h2>
    <p>This is our action plan to transform lives:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>2025:</strong> Begin in five high-need neighbourhoods</li>
        <li><strong>2026:</strong> Scale to reach every child in Singapore</li>
        <li><strong>2027:</strong> Expand with career pathways, STEM exploration, and global skills development</li>
        <li><strong>Ongoing:</strong> Continuously evolve through feedback and innovation</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2 class="section-title">6. Together We Can</h2>
    <p>This is not just a project; it is a promise. A promise that every child, regardless of where they start, can achieve their full potential. Join us to rewrite the story of opportunity in Singapore. Let’s lift our most vulnerable and, in doing so, lift us all.</p>
